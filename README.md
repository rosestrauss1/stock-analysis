# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use VBA to refactor code that uses for loops to determine the total daily volume and return for different stocks. Originally, this process was done using VBA to loop through the lines of codes until the values were identified, but in this project I refactored the code to make the process faster by only looping through the values once.

## Results

### Comparison of Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018

The stock performance in 2018 was worse than it was in 2017. This can be determined from the data because in 2017, most of the tickers had a positive return. This means that there was a positive percent increase from the starting price of the stock to the price the stock ended at. However, in 2018, almost all the tickers had a negative return. This can be easily visualized from the formatting included in VBA, which shows values that had a positive return in green and a negative return in red.
