# VBA Challenge## Overview of Project### PurposeThe purpose of this project is to use VBA to refactor code that uses for loops to determine the total daily volume and return for different stocks. Originally, this process was done using VBA to loop through the lines of codes until the values were identified, but in this project I refactored the code to make the process faster by only looping through the values once.## Results### Comparison of Stock Performance Between 2017 and 2018### Comparison of Original Script and Refactored Script## Summary### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored Code
